Racetrack Game

1. Track generation
TASK: get the scripts to run from start to finish as needed now (have a three-step,
      two-track process at present).

2. Car AI:
TASK: speed this up if possible.
TASK: add variable top speed

3. Player movement
TASK: determine winner and stop race.
TASK: make sure offCourse penalty is working.
TASK: speed up the onCourse search.  Right now, on-course dots are in an unordered
      data frame.  What if instead there was a 1/0 raster of the course (plus borders),
      then the search could be done as a indexing step--convert position to raster index
      and check value of that one raster entry.  This would be about 20 times faster.

4. Observe click and apply.
