TASK: get the scripts to run from start to finish as needed now (have a three-step,
      two-track process at present).

2. Car AI:
TASK: speed this up if possible.
TASK: add variable top speed

3. Player movement
TASK: add oil slicks.  Suggest that primary is forced for next move.  Maybe
      next two?  Probably best if AI car is set to never pass through an oil slick.

      then find a neighbor.  Only look at the NEWS neighbors--ignore diagonals.
