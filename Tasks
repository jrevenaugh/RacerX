Racetrack Game

1. Track generation
Use inkscape or the like to rotate track.  Want start finish line to be vertical and
along a straight portion of the track.

Using png_track_1.R create a data frame of track points and data frame inner and
outer boundaries.

Then run pick_centerline.R.  Pick ends of start/finish line, then the centerline of the track.
Go in clockwise fashion (NASCAR can suck it!).  Start centerline at start/finish and pass it
on the far end.

This needs to be redone for all of the tracks--I want a polygon centerline, not dots.  I
also want a better start line (line, not just dots).

Lastly, run c2d which "dots" the centerline and start/finish lines and outputs an RDS file
called track.RDS.  Rename this as needed..

2. Car AI:
TASK: speed this up if possible.
TASK: add variable top speed

3. Player movement
Simple: show grid points surrounding principle vector.  Points off track should be shown with different color.

TASK: determine winner and stop race.

4. Observe click and apply.  Done (except for AI aspect).

TASK: clean up finish line presentation and add to inset.
